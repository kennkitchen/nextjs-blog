Today I started pursuing my Google Project Management certification.

What's a nice nerd like me doing in a place like a project-management course?

All students get the chance to introduce themselves in the forum; this is what I said:

"Hi all! I'm Kenn, and I've spent my life working in IT and software development. For the last couple of years, I've worked full-time with a small company that I founded, and I entered said venture very focused on technology. However, over time, I learned that good tech wasn't enough... wasn't nearly enough! We needed someone to be focused on the "meta" aspects of our work: the strategy, the big picture.

"In the past, I've been a team leader, an executive manager, and even a certified Scrum master, but I never thought of myself as a project manager. It took this experience, with my current business, to understand the importance of project management. As a techie, there was some immature part of me that thought that "we" were the important ones and project managers were ancillary (at best!) I'm a smart guy; I can't believe I was so stupid about this, but I was. I totally didn't get it until I saw how the lack of project management was affecting our business. Despite our technical prowess, the lack of solid project management was causing us to look inept and lose the trust of our clients.

"So here I am, wiser (and humbled!) for the lessons learned and hungry to embrace the value of solid project management skills and bring them home to our business. I'm excited to be here and to be part of this community."

That pretty much sums it up. I'm sure I'll have things to share along the way about what I'm learning. And, in a few weeks, expect to see it on my resume.
